# InstaLikeChecker

Here is my third freelancing project :)
This python code signs in to your Instagram account, then goes to the post you want, gets the list of usernames, and checks if each username liked the post or not.

### Getting started:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install selenium:
```
pip install selenium
```
3. Write your username and password in [login_data.ini](https://github.com/ChamRun/InstaLikeChecker/blob/main/login_data.ini), and post url and and username in [Main.py](https://github.com/ChamRun/InstaLikeChecker/blob/main/InstaLikeChecker.py).<br><br>

   If you're using Windows and Firefox or Chrome, go to the 6th step, else:

4. Download your favourite browser driver from:
   + [Chrome](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
   + [Firefox](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
   + [Edge](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)
   + [Opera](https://github.com/operasoftware/operachromiumdriver/releases)
   + [Internet Explorer](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/)

5. Paste driver in your project directory.
 
6. Run [Main.py](https://github.com/ChamRun/Unrequester/blob/main/Main.py).<br><br>
